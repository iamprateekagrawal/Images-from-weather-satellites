After going through the projects, I got to learn about new technologies and mechanisms which I describe below:

SDR(Software Defined Radio):
1. It's basically a radio communication sysetem where components like filtes, amplifiers, modulators, etc. are implemented by means of software/digital domain.
2. It consists of the receiver, the antenna and the computer running the software.
3. We can use it to listen to aircrafts, broadcasting stations, services and many more; and find daily life applications in mobiles and TVs.

Basics of Antenna working:
1. In brief, em waves are produced upon oscillating charges of a dipole and it is received to an antenna which generally acts as a dipole.
2. The broadcasting station emits the waves to their satellites which then transmits it to our antenna aligned towards that direction.
3. There are many types of antennas like dipole and parabolic reflector.
